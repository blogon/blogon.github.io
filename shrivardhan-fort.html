<h2>Breakfast at Udhewadi</h2>

<p>
We reached our stay house around 11 AM. As soon as we entered inside we threw our bags and begged for some water to drink and wash which our host already prepared for us. We removed shoes and muddy clothes and took some wash before resting. Meanwhile our host family got busy in preparing breakfast for us. We sat for sometime and they came with hot pohe (poha) and steaming hot tea in thermos. We finished our breakfast and tea but still many of us felt tired after long walk and lay down on the floor. One was literally started snoring. :D
</p>

<h2>Rajmachi Lake</h2>

<p>
We gave some time for our lazy team mates to rest and inquired about rajmachi lake where we could have bath and get refreshed in true sense. We had to wake our team mates up to have bath which they had to agree. We went to lake with couple of buckets and pots. We carried our essential cloths and soaps.
</p>

<p>
Lake was silent and appealing however senior most person at host house had warned us not to go deep inside lake if we donâ€™t know how to swim. I along with other two buddies knew swimming so we went inside lake while remaining had bath at lake shore. We swam for a while and took bath but our sun bath got interrupted by another group of trekkers who also visited lake for bath and we decided to end our bath and head back to our stay house.
</p>

<h2>Lunch</h2>

<p>
It was around 12.30 PM and there was 1 hour before lunch. Some of our lazy friends saw an opportunity to sleep again and we allowed them to sleep while others including me went outside to explore village and enjoy the breeze.
</p>

<p>
It was 1.45 PM and we were having our lunch. I must concede that lunch was simple but really met our expectation and we enjoyed authentic home cooked lunch. While having lunch we decided that we will take 15 minute post lunch break and then head towards shrivardhan fort.
</p>

<p>
There were two forts Shrivardhan and Manaranjan fort. Since some of us were very tired we decided not to visit manaranjan fort.
</p>

<h2>Shrivardhan Fort</h2>

<p>
As we headed toward shrivardhan fort around 2.45 PM and sun got wrapped up in the clouds. Initial ascend of the fort was very smooth because of concrete staircases. We kept on ascending and saw caves and kalbhairav temple beside our main route. We decided to visit temple while descending down. As we crossed temple we found that smooth road is now getting challenging and suddenly concrete staircases got replaced by rocks and pebbles. We made our way through rocks and reach inside first checkpoint of the shrivardhan fort.
</p>

<p>
To our dismay historical structure was <strong>not maintained</strong> and was the victim of passing time. We made our way from the deteriorating structure by jumping from one rock to other to avoid accumulated stagnant rain water.
Now we were officially inside fort and reached to the point where there were three caves. Seem like these caves were also taking their last breathe as main supporting pillars were completely broken and only one pillar was providing stability. We could not get inside it because there was the water which got accumulated due to recent rain.
</p>

<p>
Just opposite to those caves we had good top view of rajmachi village and neighboring forts. We still had not reached the top of the fort and now clouds were getting darker and started sprinkling  rain drops upon us. Next lap of the fort was bit difficult because there was very little space to walk and any wrong step would have potentially thrown us off the cliff. Many of my friends were not expecting this terrain as it was their first trek but we managed to continue our ascend.

<p>
Fortunately sun again made itâ€™s way from the cloud but we could see that it was raining heavily at the opposite side of the mountain. We were witnessing scenic display of the nature.

<p>
At the top of the fort saffron flag was hoisted and the view from above, I must say <em>was stunning</em>. We could see clouds beneath us, the lake where we had bath and tiny view of mumbai pune railway line. We could literally see train passing through that route with naked eyes. Speed of wind was also very high at that altitude so we decided to take break and enjoy ! Not to mention we captured lot of cool snaps. 
</p>

<p>
We spend 20 to 30 minutes at the top and during which I got sneaked away from my fellow buddies and found one quite place to sit with my eyes closed. I must say that experience was so peaceful and mesmerizing and you wont get  such peace and pleasure in crowded cities.
</p>

<p>
We started descending from the top just to find one more dejected point where one more saffron flag was flying. That point was not in our main route and we had to descend at different direction to reach there. One of our buddy decided not to visit it and stayed back whereas remaining of us marched down toward that hoisted flag. Again we took some snaps and enjoyed view from different angle. Though there was route from that dejected pint to get down but we did not opt it as our buddy was waiting for us at the top.
</p>

<p>
We took long cut and started descending down again. We were rapidly getting down but it was more difficult as we had to effectively maintain our body balance. At some point you could only get down by sitting down. We came down till the point where road was again getting easy. 
</p>


<p>
While getting down we halted at the kalbhairav temple. It was very small temple with photo of deity framed inside it. Outside of the temple we saw two cannons kept probably from Shivaji or Peshwa era. We left that temple and after some walking found us at the bottom of the shrivardhan fort at 5.30 PM.
