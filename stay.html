<br><br>

<p>
We reached our stay house after visiting rajmachi fort and some of us were hungry. We asked our host if they prepare anything for evening snacks and they gave us three options Poha, Upma and Maggi. My friends quickly opted for maggi. They prepared our snacks and served us nicely cooked maggie and hot tea.
</p>

<p>
There was 3 hours before the dinner and my tired friends saw an opportunity to sleep again. While they were sleeping me and one more guy went outside just to see what else village is offering to the trekkers. Almost every village home was offering stay and food for the trekkers. It had created kind offree market economy and rates for stay and food got rationalized. We had chance to talk with one of the stay house and they said that cost of stay would vary according to the facility provided. I have written <a href="guide.html">complete guide to rajmachi trek</a> where you can find more details about this aspect.
</p>

<p>
Clouds were all around the rajmachi village and we were enjoying that atmosphere. It was saturday and many trekkers were pouring inside the village.</p>

<h2 id="interaction">Interaction with Locals</h2>

<p>We saw one old village women in her 70s and had chance interact with her about her lifestyle and history of the village. Our conversation went like below.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Me : Hello Granny, Do you also offer stay and food for trekkers.</p>

<p>Granny : No, I don’t offer stay or food as I am very poor with one Little hut to live. I don’t have money to invest in necessities like solar panels. Nor do I have enough energy to host people.</p>

<p>Me : What do you do for the living then ?</p>


<p>Granny : My husband has one small stall at the trail of the trek  route where he sells food and tea . However we don’t earn much money from it. I have my son living with his family in Lonavala. He has job there in one of the company. He visits us every weekend and brings necessary food and grocery. We manage whole week with whatever little that we get.</p>

<p>Me : What is the condition of the doctor and medicine in the village.</p>

<p>
Granny : There is no doctor or medicine in the village. If you are sick then nearest doctor is at lonavala. In case of emergency villages can offer bike or jeep ride till lonavala but it costs lot of money. Government appointed doctor visit village once in month but if there is rain or bad condition then they don’t pay visit.
</p>


<p>
Me : What is the situation of other necessities like water supply ?
</p>

<p>
Granny : There is common water tap for the whole village which is been sponsored by local villagers. There was one more water tank that villagers had build for drinking water but some trekkers have damaged the taps and pipes which made it useless now.
</p>

<p>
Me : For how long you are living here ?
</p>

<p>
Granny : I have born and brought up in this village only. I have been living here since last 70 years. Back then nobody used to visit fort as very less people where aware about this fort. Once in year indian military used to visit here for trekking and training in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Me : Who built trek road till this village ?
</p>

<p>
Granny : It’s very old road and built by us (villagers) for the bull kart transportation. Government and some NGOs used to provide us resources to build road and we local built it.
</p>

(Sun has set and it was getting dark)<br>

<p>Me : Thanks for talking with us. Nice to visit you.</p>

<p>
Granny : Welcome. It’s getting dark now let me go in my hut. We sleep by 7 PM here.
</p>

<p>
Me : Good Bye
</p>


<p>
Granny : Bye
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
After understanding plight of an ordinary villagers we went inside our stay house and started planning our return journey for the next day. We found that there is no train from Lonavala to Mumbai after 10.45 AM till 4.30 PM. None of us wanted to stay at lonavala station for that long. We did some calculation and come to conclusion that it would be risky to walk complete 15 KM again. We decided to hire car from Jambhali phata till Lonavala. Our host has helped us with arrangement of the car and it has costed us Rs 1000.
</p>


<p>It was around 7.45 PM and we told our host that we will be leaving early morning tomorrow and wanted to pay our dues in advance. They did some calculation and we had to pay around Rs 460 per head. I took this opportunity to interact with our host and it went like below.
</p>


<blockquote>

<p>Me : How many people do you serve here ?</p>

<p>Host : It depends on the season. During monsoon or weekends we get lot of visitors here. It could vary from 10 to 100 people. Today we got phone call that group of 90 people are visiting us tonight hence we are busy preparing food for them.</p>

<p>Me : How do you bring grocery in such large scale here ?</p>

<p>Host : We bring all required things in advance before monsoon from Lonavala. Sometime we hire vehicle to bring grocery up which cost us lot of money while on other occasion we had to bring it up ourselves by walking 15 KM with heavy load.</p>

<p>Me : Do you prepare food alone or have labors with you ?</p>

<p>Host : My family helps in preparing food and some locals here join hands with us.</p>

<p>Me : Do you have any amenities like grinder, machines etc ?</p>

<p>Host : We have grinder here but we only use if there is an emergency. As you can see we only have solar power here which is very limited. We save it to lit up our houses. So we prefer traditional stone grinder over electric mixers. We cannot use heavy machines here due to lack of electricity.</p>

<p>Me : Doesn’t it take toll on your life as it involves lot of physical work ?</p>

<p>Host : Yes it do take toll on our life but that is what we have here. Visitors visit us at any random time including late night and we have to serve them. Generally we sleep between 1 to 2 AM in night and again wake up in morning by 3.30 - 4.00 AM.</p>

<p>Me : Is it the only source of income you have ?</p>

<p>Host : No we have side business as well. I run kinder garden here in village while my husband works as postman in Indian postal service.</p>

<p>Me : Do you face any issues due to visitors ?</p>

<p>Host : Yes we face issues. Many come here in picnic mood and consume lot of alcoholic drinks and lose their sense. They create unnecessarily ruckus which create lot of trouble for us. As you can see we are family and have small children with us. Such irresponsible behavior affects decorum of our family. We don’t allow our visitors to drink and we don’t mind if we lose on money due to the same.</p>

<p>Me : Thanks for talking with us.</p> 

<p>Host : Welcome. Now I will have to get busy with cooking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since more than 90 people were visiting them our host has requested us to have early dinner and get inside our allocated room for sleeping. We agreed with them and had dinner by 8.45 PM and went in our room for sleeping by 9.45 PM. All of us were very tired and desperately needed some eye shutting. We set our mobile alarms for 4.30 AM and went into deep sleep.</p>


<h2>Return Journey</h2>

<p>Next morning sound of crowing cocks made us wake up at 4.00 AM and we started preparing for the return journey. It was dark outside and stars were shining. We got sight of Jupiter largest planet in our solar system. We got ready by 4.45 AM and started walking down.</p>

<p>We walked for around half an hour aided by our light torch. We saw one stall selling tea and stall owner invited us for the tea. We had our hot tea and started walking down again. Pre dawn light eliminated need of light torch and we saw groups of trekkers coming up at rajmachi. Many of tired legs coming up were asking us <em>how much time will it take to reach rajmachi</em>.</p>

<p>We were equally eager to reach Jambhali phata where our car was waiting for us. Finally we arrived at point where locals have digged road to make sure no car would enter from that point. It was preventive measure as lot of cars get stuck in rain after that point. We walked few meters from digged road and saw white sumo was waiting for us.</p>

<p>All of us jumped inside car with happy faces and car driver started the engine. Road was still uneven and muddy for the car but our driver skillfully made his way. We reached lonavala at 7.45 AM and it took 30 Minutes of vehicle journey from Jambhali phata.</p>

<p>We were 2 hour ahead of our planned schedule and we targeted 8.39 AM Pragati Express and had lot of time in our hand. We relaxed, had breakfast at lonavala. We also purchased Chikkis at Lonavala station.</p>

<p>At last our train arrived and we headed in general compartment. Not to our surprise there was no place to seat and many were already standing. But some of us got seat at Karjat while others got at Panvel</p>

<p>It was Sunday and Megablock delayed our train by 1 Hour but thankfully all of us had seat and could relax in the train. Finally we reached dadar station by 12 PM and headed towards our home.</p>

<p>Though we were tired and fatigued I must say we still had lot of enthusiasm and energy which was the happy ending to our trek. Not only our trek bags were of stuff but also our memories were full of happy and refreshing experience. Please <strong>do visit Rajmachi</strong> and have an <em>amazing experience</em> like we did.</p>
