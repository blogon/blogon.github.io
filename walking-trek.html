<p>Monsoon was about to start and after the game of football my football budies asked me <i>“Will I be able to join them for monsoon trek at rajmachi ?”</i> Without moment of hesitation I said <em>YES, Please Count me in !!!</em>

<p>It was first weekend of July we planned our trek. Initially we were 11 strong but as usual many canceled one after other with domino effect  (you know what I mean) and we ended up with 7 strong.</p>

<p>We were in Mumbai and planned trek from lonavala to rajmachi by walking. You can reach rajmachi from karjat as well but that is considered as slightly difficult terrain. Many of my friends were doing first trek so we decided to stick to familiar and easy Lonavala route. From Lonavala you can hire private vehicle till della adventure park which will save lot of walking but we did not opt it and decided to walk. For more details about this I have wrote <a href="guide.html" title="Read this guide before you plan rajmachi trek">comprehensive guide to rajmachi trek</a>. In this post I would just narrate our trek experience.</p>

<p>It was Friday and we decided to take late night train from CST to Lonavala. As it was working day for me I told my friends that I would meet them directly at CST from office which mean I had to carry heavy trekking bag in office which I eventually did. As they say <em>No pain, No Gain !!!</em></p>

<p>We met at CST and took some cold drinks and snacks to eat at Lonavala station. We took Shirdi Fast Passenger from CST at 10.55 PM. One of my friend observed it has many unreserved general coach and we would easily get seat till Lonavala without competing with fellow passengers. Ticket was very cheap too 30 INR per Head :D (thanks to Indian railways and honest taxpayers).</p>

<p>We had some cheat chatting and light snacks in train till Lonavala station and finally reached Lonavala around 2.00 PM. Since it was very dark we decided to have a snacks and take some rest at Lonavala station before commencing our trek.</p>

<p>We started our trek at 4.45 AM and it was still dark but we had couple of torches to assist us. We had google map and 4g connection handy and paved our way from usually busy but now empty lonavala streets. Many jumping street frogs and barking dogs welcomed us and we accepted their greetings with big heart. Thankfully there were no snakes involved in this party.</p>

<p>We kept on marching for 30 to 45 Minutes covering distance of 3 KM and crossed Mumbai Pune Highway (NH48). Sun was about to rise and we were getting pre dawn light which eliminated need of torch. We found our way from couple of some of small villages. It was raw soil road and was turning into single road without diversion as main route to rajmachi. We were happy about it as we need not to keep on checking GPS whether or not we are on the right track.</p>

<p>There was amazingly refreshing air unified with sound of chirping birds which was taking our energy to whole new level. We found many small waterfalls some were hiding under bushes and others were exposing their beauty. We took break from walking and captured beauty of nature in our cameras. Unfortunately we could not appreciate it for long as we had long way to go and off course there was more joy to come.</p>

<p>Again we continued our walking for an hour but needed some food to keep our momentum going. Fortunately we found one isolated tea stall run by local villager which served us eggs, chips and much needed hot tea.</p>

<p>After fueling our stomach we walked for half an hour and reached a point where stream water was flowing through rocks and we saw fellow trekkers were enjoying it. We had decided to walk without stop but we could not resist our temptation and unanimously agreed to stop and enjoy the cold water. We took off our trekking shoes and sat on rocks with legs in rapid flowing cold water. It was very soothing experiences to our tired legs. We enjoyed it for 15-20 minutes before taking our shoes on again. Bright side of this break was that as we resumed our walking our legs felt rejuvenated with cold water stream and we did not regret dime for this halt.</p>

<p>We kept on walking and road was becoming more muddy, slippery and steeper. Forsaken wooden sticks from the tree branches came to our rescue and we held sticks in our hand to balance as we walked. I could feel the tiredness in my fellow buddies but we kept our humor on and cracked lot of jokes which kept our morale high. To our good or bad there was no rain. Bad because it imposed sun rays on us and good because otherwise it would have made road more muddy and slippery. Sky was clear for the sunny day and sun was coming up on horizon. We suddenly felt urgency of reaching village before sun rays become more intense. We decreased our halt frequency and increased our walking speed. </p>

<p>Finally after around 6 hours of walking we reached rajmachi village where we paid Rs 10 per person for toll at village entrance. I was skeptical at first but been informed that they collect this toll to maintain the fort, I hoped they did however we were not in position to investigate or argue with collector and promptly paid our toll to enter inside village.</p>

<p>One of our friend had already made contact with local villagers for the facilitating food and overnight stay. We surveyed our host and finally found one house to meet them. We briefly concluded our walk.</p>
